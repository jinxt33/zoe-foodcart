## Description
This project showcases my understanding of what we've learned so far in class. It uses a variety of HTML tags, CSS tricks and even Bootstrap elements! I'm always dreaming about food and starting a lucrative BaoZi food cart business with my buddy Joe. This website is a peek into what that fantasy could be! Maybe one day I will translate this into the real world! Yasssss.
